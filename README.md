I don't really know what to put here but..

# Basic intro time let's gooo

Hi, I'm Kaizoku, kaizo is fine. Before you ask me why it sounds japanese, it is. Kaizoku is japanese for pirate (no, I'm not a pirate). Here you can find my ever growing amount of repos filled with dumb stuff to actual useful stuff. I work on python-based applications, but who knows, eventually I might dabble in other languages. (I use Arch BTW)

## Stuff I've done
Alot of dumb stuff, some pretty useful like..
- [DummiesNmap](https://github.com/kaizokuv/dummiesnmap) - A 'simplified' version of Nmap (I am dumb and couldn't understand the flags so I dummified it for myself) with some added functionalities
- [Ange1Encrypt3r](https://github.com/kaizokuv/Ange1Encrypt3r) - A 3-step encrypter/decrypter using custom substitution patterns (if given), hexing and AES

And others more on the dumb/kinda just there stuff..
- [AutoEmailApplier](https://github.com/kaizokuv/AutoEmailApplier) - A auto emailer I made that would take inputs and sends a generated email applciation to a chosen company (made this to get a job, ended uop getting a job with that very email)
- [RandomCafeSystem](https://github.com/kaizokuv/RandomCafeSystem) - A random project that just exists to get me back up to speed in python
- [UltraCTF](https://github.com/kaizokuv/UltraCTF) - A CTF tool, inspired to [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef), but made offline (Now archived)

## Currently working on
I figured since [DummiesNmap](https://github.com/kaizokuv/dummiesnmap) was a relatively good idea, and I'm a pretty stupid lad, I might as well make a bunch of programs that are dummified versions of the main thing, while making it easier for beginners to understand, while adding some extra functionality. So the current project is a revamp of [UltraCTF](https://github.com/kaizokuv/UltraCTF), and moving it to the Dummies family

## Anything else?
Nah not really, but if you wanna find me ehhh..
